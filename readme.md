## 🧠 GitHub Copilot: A Developer's Perspective

### 🚀 When was it launched?
GitHub Copilot was first announced on **June 29, 2021** as a technical preview. It became publicly available in **October 2021**.

### 🧬 Who launched it?
Copilot was developed by **GitHub** in collaboration with **OpenAI**, and is now part of Microsoft's developer ecosystem.

### 📦 Original source
Copilot is powered by **OpenAI Codex**, a descendant of GPT-3, trained on billions of lines of public code from GitHub and other sources.  
Today, GitHub Copilot supports **multiple AI models**, including:
- **GPT-4.1** and **GPT-4o** for general-purpose coding and writing
- **Claude Sonnet** and **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for fast, responsive completions
- **OpenAI o1** for deep reasoning and architecture-level code analysis

### 🤝 What is it like to use?
Think of it as **pair programming with an AI assistant**. You start typing a line of code, and Copilot tries to understand your intent, predict what comes next, and suggest completions — from single lines to entire functions.

### 🔄 Can we switch it on and off?
Yes.  
You can toggle GitHub Copilot in your IDE settings:
- **VS Code**: Go to `Settings > Extensions > GitHub Copilot`, then enable/disable.
- Or use the command palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `GitHub Copilot: Enable/Disable`.

---

### 🧭 Can we access more than one suggestion?
Yes.  
In VS Code, after Copilot suggests a completion:
- Press `Alt+[` or `Alt+]` to cycle through multiple suggestions.
- Or use `Ctrl+Enter` to open the **Copilot panel** and view alternatives.

### 💡 Can you be a good programmer without it?
Absolutely.  
Copilot is a tool — not a substitute for understanding. It can speed up routine tasks and offer inspiration, but **your logic, design, and debugging skills still matter**.  
On a light note: *Yes, you can still be a great dev without it. I’ve been coding since 2016, and that hasn’t changed.*
